// As with ESLint, Babel requires some configuration to make
// it useful. For this project, you’ll start with two popular Babel presets:

// The React preset, which provides support for JSX.
// The env preset, which provides support for all new JavaScript syntax features
// defined in ES2015 (a.k.a. ES6), ES2016, and ES2017. The name “env” refers to
// its ability to tailor the transpilation pipeline to a specified set of target environments.
